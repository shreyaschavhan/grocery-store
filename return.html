                        We at Redwolf strive to give you a quality product of your choice. However if you are not happy
                        with the order that you have received for any reason, you can mail us at orders@redwolf.in.

                        What is Redwolf's Exchange Policy for T-shirts?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you are unhappy with the product that you have received or need a size change, you can
                        request a return for it from your Orders Page.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once the returned item(s) are received back, they will be checked and we will issue credits in
                        your Redwolf Wallet for the value of the products returned. (Cash on Delivery handling charges
                        are non-refundable). You can then use these credits to place a new order.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Items will have to be unused and returned within 15 days of delivery.

                        What sort of checks do you do for Returned products?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We check products to ensure that they are unused and in the same condition as they were when
                        they were sent out to you. Clothing products with tags should have the brand tags intact,
                        products with removed tags indicate usage and will not be accepted for returns.

                        How long will the return process take?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once you request a return, we will arrange for the product to be picked up from your address.
                        This Reverse Pickup facility is only available for pin codes supported for Reverse Pickups by
                        our courier partners. You will need to keep the product(s) packed and ready for pick-up. We will
                        issue credit for your return after it reaches our office and the products are verified. This
                        process will take 7-10 working days from the date of raising the return request.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What if my pincode is not supported for Reverse Pickups?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We request you to self-ship the product to us. We will credit your Redwolf Wallet with credits
                        worth Rs.100 in lieu of the shipping costs.

                        How do I self-ship the products?

                        Please pack the items securely to prevent any loss or damage during transit. All items must be
                        in unused condition with all original tags attached and packaging intact.
